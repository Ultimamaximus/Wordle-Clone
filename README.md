# Wordle Game Clone

Welcome to my Wordle clone! This project is a recreation of the popular online game where the goal is to guess a 5-letter word within 6 attempts.

## Description 

This is a simple and fun web-based game that challenges you to guess the hidden word based on color-coded feedback from your previous guesses.

## How to Play

1. Start by guessing any 5-letter word.
2. Once entered, each letter of your guess will change color according to the following rules:
   - Green: The letter is correct and in the right position.
   - Yellow: The letter is correct but in the wrong position.
   - Gray: The letter does not exist in the word.
3. Based on the feedback from your guesses, attempt to deduce the word!
4. Remember, you only have 6 chances. Good luck!
